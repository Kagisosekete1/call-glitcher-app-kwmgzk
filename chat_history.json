When activated, the app introduces audio glitches, delays, and simulated drops, making it appear to the caller that the user has bad network connectivity.\r\n\r\nCore Features:\r\n1. Call Interception:\r\n   - Listen for incoming calls via TelephonyManager on Android.\r\n   - Use CallKit on iOS.\r\n   - Display an overlay with \"Activate Jam\" and \"Decline\" buttons during a call.\r\n\r\n2. Fake Network Lag:\r\n   - Manipulate call audio using DSP to introduce jitter, static, random silence, and delay.\r\n   - Adjustable lag intensity (Low, Medium, High).\r\n\r\n3. Auto Disconnect:\r\n   - Optional feature that ends the call after X seconds of glitch simulation.\r\n   - Allow user to set time in settings (5\u201360 seconds).\r\n\r\n4. Custom Trigger:\r\n   - Contacts list integration to mark numbers for auto-jamming.\r\n   - Manual \u201cJam Now\u201d button on active call screen.\r\n\r\n5. Stealth Mode:\r\n   - Background service that silently intercepts and applies settings.\r\n   - No notification shown to caller.\r\n\r\nTechnical Implementation:\r\n- Android:\r\n  Permissions: READ_PHONE_STATE, CALL_PHONE, MODIFY_PHONE_STATE, RECORD_AUDIO, FOREGROUND_SERVICE.\r\n  APIs: TelephonyManager, AudioManager.\r\n- iOS:\r\n  Permissions: Microphone, CallKit integration.\r\n  APIs: CallKit, AVAudioEngine.\r\n\r\nUI Layout:\r\n- MainActivity:\r\n  - Large toggle switch for \u201cJam Mode\u201d (on/off).\r\n  - Status text at top (\"Jam Mode Active\" / \"Idle\").\r\n  - Quick Action Buttons: \u201cJam Now\u201d, \u201cEnd Call\u201d.\r\n- ContactsActivity:\r\n  - RecyclerView list of contacts with checkboxes.\r\n  - Search bar.\r\n  - Add Manual Number button.\r\n- SettingsActivity:\r\n  - Sliders for Glitch Duration, Lag Intensity, Static Volume.\r\n  - Toggles for Auto Disconnect, Stealth Mode.\r\n  - Dropdown for Glitch Type: Packet Loss, Static Noise, Delay, Mixed.\r\n- LogActivity:\r\n  - RecyclerView showing history of jammed calls.\r\n\r\nNavigation:\r\nBottomNavigationView with tabs:\r\n[Home] [Contacts] [Settings] [Log]\r\n\r\nExtra Details:\r\n- Animated glowing network bars icon when Jam Mode is active.\r\n- Vibration feedback when Jam Mode starts/stops.\r\n- Dark mode UI by default.\r\n\r\nDeliverables:\r\n- Full Android Studio project in Kotlin.\r\n- Xcode Swift project for iOS with identical functionality.\r\n- Ready for publishing to Google Play Store and Apple App Store.\r\n- Include privacy policy placeholder and permission request dialogs.\r\n"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand you're looking to build \"Call Glitcher,\" a cross-platform app that simulates poor network quality during calls.
