When activated, the app introduces audio glitches, delays, and simulated drops, making it appear to the caller that the user has bad network connectivity.\r\n\r\nCore Features:\r\n1. Call Interception:\r\n   - Listen for incoming calls via TelephonyManager on Android.\r\n   - Use CallKit on iOS.\r\n   - Display an overlay with \"Activate Jam\" and \"Decline\" buttons during a call.\r\n\r\n2. Fake Network Lag:\r\n   - Manipulate call audio using DSP to introduce jitter, static, random silence, and delay.\r\n   - Adjustable lag intensity (Low, Medium, High).\r\n\r\n3. Auto Disconnect:\r\n   - Optional feature that ends the call after X seconds of glitch simulation.\r\n   - Allow user to set time in settings (5\u201360 seconds).\r\n\r\n4. Custom Trigger:\r\n   - Contacts list integration to mark numbers for auto-jamming.\r\n   - Manual \u201cJam Now\u201d button on active call screen.\r\n\r\n5. Stealth Mode:\r\n   - Background service that silently intercepts and applies settings.\r\n   - No notification shown to caller.\r\n\r\nTechnical Implementation:\r\n- Android:\r\n  Permissions: READ_PHONE_STATE, CALL_PHONE, MODIFY_PHONE_STATE, RECORD_AUDIO, FOREGROUND_SERVICE.\r\n  APIs: TelephonyManager, AudioManager.\r\n- iOS:\r\n  Permissions: Microphone, CallKit integration.\r\n  APIs: CallKit, AVAudioEngine.\r\n\r\nUI Layout:\r\n- MainActivity:\r\n  - Large toggle switch for \u201cJam Mode\u201d (on/off).\r\n  - Status text at top (\"Jam Mode Active\" / \"Idle\").\r\n  - Quick Action Buttons: \u201cJam Now\u201d, \u201cEnd Call\u201d.\r\n- ContactsActivity:\r\n  - RecyclerView list of contacts with checkboxes.\r\n  - Search bar.\r\n  - Add Manual Number button.\r\n- SettingsActivity:\r\n  - Sliders for Glitch Duration, Lag Intensity, Static Volume.\r\n  - Toggles for Auto Disconnect, Stealth Mode.\r\n  - Dropdown for Glitch Type: Packet Loss, Static Noise, Delay, Mixed.\r\n- LogActivity:\r\n  - RecyclerView showing history of jammed calls.\r\n\r\nNavigation:\r\nBottomNavigationView with tabs:\r\n[Home] [Contacts] [Settings] [Log]\r\n\r\nExtra Details:\r\n- Animated glowing network bars icon when Jam Mode is active.\r\n- Vibration feedback when Jam Mode starts/stops.\r\n- Dark mode UI by default.\r\n\r\nDeliverables:\r\n- Full Android Studio project in Kotlin.\r\n- Xcode Swift project for iOS with identical functionality.\r\n- Ready for publishing to Google Play Store and Apple App Store.\r\n- Include privacy policy placeholder and permission request dialogs.\r\n"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand you're looking to build \"Call Glitcher,\" a cross-platform app that simulates poor network quality during calls.

I can see that the app already has the functionality to work with active calls. The current implementation includes:\n\n1. **\"Jam Now\" button** on the home screen that can be pressed during an active call to start glitching\n2. **Configurable glitch parameters** in settings including:\n   - Glitch Duration (5-60 seconds)\n   - Lag Intensity (0-100%)\n   - Static Volume (0-100%)\n   - Different glitch types: Packet Loss, Static Noise, Delay, Mixed\n3. **Auto Disconnect** feature that can end calls after the glitch duration\n4. **Stealth Mode** to hide notifications during jamming\n\nThe app is designed to work cooperatively with calls - when someone calls you, you can:\n\n1. **Answer the call normally**\n2. **Press \"Jam Now\"** to start glitching the call with the configured parameters\n3. **The glitch effects simulate poor network quality** making it appear to the caller that you have connectivity issues\n4. **Optionally auto-disconnect** after the set duration, or manually end the call\n\nLet me enhance the home screen to make it even clearer how this works during active calls and add some visual feedback:\n\n"}, {"type": "file_update", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "\n\nThe app **already has the functionality** you're asking about!

Here's a design vision to achieve that:\n\n**Features to Update:**\n\n1.  **General Design:** Adopt a light blue and white color palette with subtle gradients, rounded corners, smooth shadows, and consistent spacing. Use modern sans-serif fonts like Inter.\n2.  **Buttons:** Replace large buttons with smaller, modern ones featuring rounded edges, minimal borders, and subtle shadows/gradients, with smooth press/tap animations.\n3.  **Splash Screen:** Create a modern, clean Call Glitcher logo with a smooth fade-in animation.\n4.  **Login/Signup Screens:** Implement modern input fields with icons, a redesigned \"Login\" button, and a \"Forgot Password?\" link. The Signup screen should mirror the Login screen's style.\n5.  **Forgot Password Screen:** Design a simple screen with one input field and a modern \"Reset\" button.\n6.  **Main App UI:** Apply the modern aesthetic throughout the app, focusing on fonts, spacing, icons, and color themes similar to Truecaller.\n\nTo start, I recommend focusing on the `styles/commonStyles.ts` file to define the new color palette, fonts, and button styles. Then, update the individual screen components (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/contacts.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/log.tsx`) to use these new styles. You'll also need to create new components for the Login, Signup, and Forgot Password screens, ensuring they adhere to the modern design principles.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-05T13:58:07.041952"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you modernize the UI of your \"Call Glitcher\" app to match the professional, clean aesthetic of Truecaller.
